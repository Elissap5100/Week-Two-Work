# Journal Entry for Week Two

**Instructions:** In your journal.md for this week, think about, who pays for work to end up online? Who does the work? What are some of the ethical dimensions of doing this work? Does Carleton give you any resources for getting those materials onto your own machine in formats you can read? What are some of the barriers to accessing the resources that Carleton does make available to you? Where do you fit into this digital history machine? Put your journal.md into your github repo for week 2.

## Who pays for work to end up online?

After reading the various texts and exploring certain data bases and websites this week, I have learned that the source of income for many of these projects comes from a multitude of people and organizations. The one thing I believe each party has in common, is that they must at least have a passion for the project or believe in what they are helping to fund. In the case of the the Transcribe Bentham project that we took an indepth look at this week, it was funded by various organizations that explicitly were created to supports projects such as this one. Undoubtedly, it is a risk to pour money into a crowdsourcing project but it makes it much easier to take that leap with your money if you truely care about the outcome of the project. 

## Who does the work?

Similar to my last reflection, I believe the work is done by, again, a multitude of people from various standings, skill levels and technological/historical backgrounds. From the various projects we took a look at this week, we discovered that there are paid employees (historians, archivists, IT specialists, etc) that take part in this work, dedicated and passionate volunteers, as well as the every day person who stumbles across this "world". As I mentioned, in the case of volunteers, I believe one must have a deep nterest in the work they are supporting in order to offer their help. For example, transcribing douzens of pages for the Bentham Project on a volunteer standing is a lot of hard work to not be paid for. There are riguorious editing processes and user guidelines to follow. That is a lot of effort for someone to use, especially if they were not interested in the project.

## What are some of the ethical dimensions of doing this work?

I do not completely understand this question, but I think in reality this concept mainly applies to the project that is being worked on or funded. It is my understanding that most online historical platforms, collections, databases or archives are compiled and constantly worked on by a mix of paid employees and volunteers through various levels of the crowdsourcing technique. I think ethics come into play most when one considers the treatment of volunteers vs paid employees.
    - Who can be a volunteer? what is the screen process for this and is it fair?
    - How much work should a volunteer be allowed to do? Can they do more than a paid employee? At what point should they get paid or recieve some type of recognition? Is there a way to transition?
    -As a paid employee, what is your role? How much 'control' do they have over volunteers? What happens when a paid employee's role is eerily similar to that of a volunteer? Are they expeted to do more than volunteers?
    - Can the project demand more of their already hard working volunteers? Can volunteers be asked to easily adapt to changes as a paid employee would?
    
Another side to consider is the money projects such as the Bentham Project recieves and what is the best/fair thing to do with it. Certain questions that may arise can include:
    - What makes one project more deserving of funding than another?
    - Where should the money go? 
    - Should it be used to develop a better volunteer programsystem, hire another employee, rework the onlone platform, invest in more sources for the project, marketing, etc?

## Does Carleton give you any resources for getting those materials onto your own machine in formats you can read?

I will be completely honest in saying that my program at carleton does not exactly delve into this area of study and research. To my knowledge, I do not think Carleton offers much in the way of transfering physical materials onto my own machine in a digital fashion. I know the library has plenty of ressources available and a collection of many physical (and online) books, articles, journals and more we can explore. If needed, I think a student can use the copiers and scanners from the library (for a certain price I believe) to scan the pages of a book and then email it to our student accounts. Aftick google search, I did discover carleton has a "Archive and Special Collection" portal on their library website that might be of some interest (https://asc.library.carleton.ca/). Although, it is in my opinion that it is courses like this one that are some of Carleton's more powerful tools. From personal experience, I had no idea that I would learn the research methods and tools I have (only on the second week no less) that I feel will help me a lot in my future studies. I think it would be beneficil for carleton to offer certain training seinars for techniques like the ones taught in this class, or reccomend courses like this to more students.

## What are some of the barriers to accessing the resources that Carleton does make available to you?

I touched upon this answer in my last reflection, but I believe the main obstacles students face in acessing these resources would be the financial buren of it all, inability to know how to searh for information properly and an overall lack of awareness. Firstly, it is expensive to be a student. I know sometimes I have be told to look at journals, articles or reports that I can not access because I need to subscribe to the platform or buy the full version of the text. Some people do not mind this, bt for many, it is a major road block. Secondly, I am positive that when students, both at the gradtuate and undergraduate level, conduct research, they are not doing it right. The professor mentioned it in his lesson plan this week even, "Just because you searched, didnâ€™t mean you found what was there!" Even if Carleton has a bounty full of amazing tools that we have access to, he average student probaby does not know how to find them or use hem correctly to find what they need. Finally, I think this is the largest road bump, students simply do not know what is available. This is true especially if you are in a program that is not heavy on researching like in the social sciences and more writing. 

## Where do you fit into this digital history machine?

A question similar to this one was asked last week, and I still feel the same. I am not entirely
