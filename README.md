# Week-Two-Work

## Notes From The Readings

#### http://www.cameronblevins.org/posts/topic-modeling-martha-ballards-diary/
  - **Text Mining** : is the process of deriving high-quality information from text. High-quality information is typically derived through the devising of patterns and trends through means such as statistical pattern learning.
    - Computer can only count literal language, not figuartive (different approaches to say God)
  - **Topic Modeling** : a method of computational linguistics that attempts to find words that frequently appear together within a text and then group them into clusters. 
    - There are programs (Mallet) that do this... interesting!
      - the program is only concerned with how the words are used in the text, and specifically what words tend to be used similarly.
      - Results correlate with events in the diary/her life (proving algorith/program works)

    - *I copied lines from the text I felt were inportant/new to me and offered brief thoughts on some based on this weeks other lessons*
    - "... argues that we need a humanities approach to the graphical expression of interpretation."
    - "... the concept of data as a given has to be rethought through a humanistic lens and characterized as capta, taken and constructed."
    - "... the forms for graphical expression of capta need to be more nuanced to show ambiguity and complexity."
    - "... the use of a humanistic approach, rooted in a co-dependent relation between observer and experience, needs to be expressed according to graphics built from interpretative models."
  
  - **Data as capta: from information visualization to graphical expressions of interpretation**
    - "... humanistic approach means that the premises are rooted in the recognition of the interpretative nature of knowledge, that the display itself is conceived to embody qualitative expressions, and that the information is understood as graphically constituted."
    - "... In conventional statistical graphics, the scale divisions are equal units. In humanistic, interpretative, graphics, they are not."
      - *This relates to arguing literal (data) vs figrative (capta).... they are applying contex and relative information to the data vizualized which cahnges the representation of said data entirely*
    - "... Perhaps the most striking feature distinguishing humanistic, interpretative, and constructivist graphical expressions from realist statistical graphics is that the curves, bars, columns, percentage values would not always be represented as discrete bounded entities, but as conditional expressions of interpretative parametersâ€“a kind of visual fuzzy logic or graphical complexity."
    - "... The challenge is to design graphical expressions suited to the display of interpreted phenomena: information about subjective user-dependent metrics, subjective displays of information, and subjective methods of graphical expression. 
      - "The term subjective is used as shorthand for interpretative construction, for the registration of point of view..."
      - *NOT indivdual persepctive.. more grand scale*

 - **Time as Temporality**
    - "The relational structure of temporality is always constituted according to inflections and variables. Not all days are equal. Or all minutes. Or all hours. Time understood as temporality can be succinctly stated as follows: Temporality = time as a factor of X where X is any variable (fear, speed, anxiety, foreshadowing, regret, reconsideration, narration, etc.)."
        - *This is a really interesting concept... especially looking at time through a "story telling" lense*
        - *This goes above my head honestly, but from what little I understand its a pretty fresh perspective of time. It almost makes it up for debate on how people measure time, which is a concept I had never given much thought to.*
        
- **Space as Spatiality**
    - Corresponds to the theory of time
    - "... and the distinctions between the conception of space as an a priori given and that of space as relationally constituted marks the same philosophical division of approaches as those that are used in charting or understanding time and temporality."
    - " ... To give graphical expression to these ideas requires using non-standard metrics, intuitive and subjective principles of design. They are meant as provocations to the larger project of creating more systematic renderings of humanistic phenomena... "
    - *This example helped me understand the whole concept a little more than before...*
        - "We can construct a concrete example of spatiality that parallels this example of temporality, and also depends on temporal models. For instance, imagine an open stretch of beach, relatively unconstrained and unconstructed. When a sailing ship is washed up at a certain point on the beach, not only that point, but the space around it, becomes transformed. The presence of the wreck creates a huge impact, and the space almost palpably bends, compresses, expands, and warps around it, with waves of resonance rippling outward from that point."
    - *The map example as well is really interesting (map represented spatially then disorted to reflect fear as a variable of its representation.*
    - INTERESTING POINT HERE (text is dated but): The challenge of representing large corpora of texts and immense archives also requires attention, in part because the conventions of wayfinding and navigation that are part of print media and its institutional structures are not yet reworked in a digital environment meant to address the shifts in scale and experience brought on by new media.
    
 - Overall interesting read with very new ideas for me. A little too advance for my level but it was nice to learn about this topic a bit more!

- I have never been a huge fan of twitter, as I found it to be a bit of a mindless platform that constantly creates drama. Although I will admit, reading this informational and interesting threads has been quite cool! I like seeing this medium in a different light. I had never though it could be used like this, but it is quite effective.
- Overall, I really liked this thread. I actually found it super intersting to see how they move through from the physical to the digital. It was short, straight tot he poit and easy to understand.
- I took a look at some of the projects (https://t.co/IZELTP6W2X?amp=1), and I was really impressed by what people can do. I found the data vizualization examples such a genius idea. Seeing people using Minecraft to correctly recreate certain environments both surprised me and blew me away. I really love seeing people "repurpose" certain tools at their dispoal to to things like this!

- I did not explore this too heavily as I assume the following readings in the lesson plan will hep me more, but I am glad I saw this. I had no idea projects like this exist and I am impressed by the collaborative trust and spirit it has. The whole concept is very impressive (especially the amount of work that goes into it and how much has been done). It makes me wonder what other things like exist...

- **Crowd Sourcing** : obtain (information or input into a particular task or project) by enlisting the services of a large number of people, either paid or unpaid, typically via the Internet.
- **Amazon Mechanical Turk platform** : where users are asked to carry out atomized tasks in return for some small monetary reward.
- I feel a lot of trust must go into these volunteers... is there a screening process or editing
